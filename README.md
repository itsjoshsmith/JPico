# JPico

> [!CAUTION]
> This repo is very much a work in progress with many un-tested sections of code that frankly may not work yet, I will be adding a confidence flag for each component in the repo after testing.

JPico is a collection of utilities, tools and sensor interfaces compiled for the Pico 2 and thus uses the Pico SDK V2, specifically 2.1.1 at the moment.

The JPico.c file in the root of the repo is currently being used as a test bed file for indvidual components that end up making it into the collection of tools.

The Wiki will end up holding examples and documentation for the individual bits as and when they are tested.
