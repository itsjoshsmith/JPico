# JPico

> [!CAUTION]
> This repo is very much a work in progress

JPico is a collection of utilities, tools and sensor interfaces built for the Pico 2 and thus uses the Pico SDK V2, specifically 2.1.1 at the moment.

The JPico.c file in the root of the repo is currently being used as a test bed file for indvidual components that end up making it into the collection.

The Wiki will end up having the individual component documentation inside it rather than cramming the readme
